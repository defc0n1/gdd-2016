## Projects

These are some of the projects that were created during Game Dev Day:

- [adam-thomas/gdd-spore](https://github.com/adam-thomas/gdd-spore) - The beginnings of a Spore-like planet eating simulator.
- [gfwilliams/PainRun](https://github.com/gfwilliams/PainRun) - A bad (but ad-free!) copy of Death Run 3D... and in VR!
- [edent/aframedemo](https://github.com/edent/aframedemo/tree/gh-pages) - A quick hackday project to make an immersive VR art gallery.
- [adjl/CryingAngels](https://github.com/adjl/CryingAngels) - The idea is to have the Weeping Crying Angels pursue you in a maze; they stop when you look at them. This repo focuses on the implementation of the latter mechanic.
- [lpmi-13/privateRepository](https://github.com/lpmi-13/privateRepository) - Word breakout, where the words change to their plural form

If I've missed any projects, or described them wrong, submit a pull request!
